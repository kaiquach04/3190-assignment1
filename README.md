# 319_Assignment_1
**1. Overview**
This assignment serves as a foundational step in organizing ideas for the Midterm Project. While your
midterm project may differ, this assignment encapsulates many of the requirements expected for the
midterm.

You will download examples from the Bootstrap web page and select a template that aligns with your
vision for the Midterm Project.

Our focus is on creating a "Catalog of Products," inspired by the Activity In-class where we constructed
a Catalog of Flowers. While the class activity wasn't intended for sales, it can serve as a prototype for
advertising various products. However, you are free to choose a different Bootstrap example for this
assignment.

You will source **images** and **text** from the Internet or create them using original content. Exercise
caution with copyrighted material, ensuring compliance with privacy policies.
This assignment is a collaborative effort among team members. Sharing content with other teams is
prohibited.

Avoid using images and text from the class activity.
Be mindful that Bootstrap templates may include unnecessary code. Remove extraneous details to
tailor the project to its requirements.
